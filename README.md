### Job Salary Prediction

The aim of this project is to predict the salary of a Job by looking
at the content of a job description, job location, job category and
various other features associated with a job advertisement. The
project is inspired from an online [Kaggle] competition
program. We try linear and non-linear decision boundary
algorithms on the dataset and try to find out which one gives us
the best results. We also try cluster analysis for classifying
dataset. Later we use the same cluster analysis to do unsupervised
learning and try to find interesting patterns within clusters of the
same salary range and between clusters of different salary range. In our cluster analysis we find how meaning of a word changes with change in salary. 

This project was done as part of CSE-512 project requirement of Machine Learning in Stony Brook University - Spring 2015.

The details of the results from the dataset are in [pdf].
